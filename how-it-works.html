            <h1>How It Works</h1>
            <p>Buying Tokens: You purchase PrizePool Tokens (PPL) just like you would buy any other cryptocurrency.</p>
            <p>Holding Tokens: To be eligible for the lottery, you need to hold at least 5000 tokens.</p>
            <p>Tax on Transactions: Every time someone transfers tokens (buys, sells, or sends them), a small fee (5%) is taken from the transaction. This fee is split and added to three different prize pools: bi-weekly, semi-quarterly, and annual.</p>
            <p>Prize Pools: Bi-Weekly Pool, Semi-Quarterly Pool, Annual Pool.</p>
            <p>Eligibility: If your balance is 5000 tokens or more, you are automatically added to the list of eligible participants for the lottery. If your balance drops below 5000 tokens, you are removed from the list.</p>
            <p>Choosing Winners: Winners are randomly selected based on the lottery type.</p>
            <p>Winning: If you win, the prize amount is transferred to your wallet.</p>
